          <p>When you not used to believing in yourself its hard to start. You so used to hearing this voice in your head or someone telling you that you will never be anything
            in life. That everytime you try to do something that you want to do that person voice or your voice comes in your head. It discourage you to not do better. Just know that you 
            can overcome that voice. Its good to repeat the words I am somebody .I will be somebody. I can do anyting I put my mind to.</p>
